    Are you familiar with the basic rules of Hitster yet? Great, because this is
    a list of advanced features and settings you can configure to make your game
    more difficult, or easier, just as you like.

    <ul>
        <li>Every game has a game settings button which allows you to:
            <ul>
                <li>change the amount of hits required to win a game</li>
                <li>change the amount of tokens every player starts with</li>
                <li>specify which card packs you want to use in your game</li>
                <li>control wether the hits you already listened to will be saved between rounds so that you don't have to guess them again in a future round</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You can also pay 3 tokens during your turn to immediately add a random hit to your time line. Find the corresponding button within the game actions section.</li>
        <li>You can browse the shortcuts page to get an overview over all the hidden key shortcuts across the entire game, which can make your life much easier. Said page can be found within the main menu.</li>
    </ul>
manualAdvancedTitle: Advanced
manualBasic: >
    This is how you play the game:

    <ol>
        <li>You start the game with one randomly dealt hit card, visible to all players. Each hit card displays the name of a song, the artist and the year it was released. Some hit cards also include additional information, like a film or series the song is associated with.</li>
        <li>Each round begins with the computer drawing a random hit card, nobody sees what's on it. Everyone listens to the song on the hidden hit card for 20 seconds. During your turn, you have to guess whether this mystery hit that's playing was released before or after the song on the first card you've been dealt. If you're correct about when the song was released, the hit you've identified will get added to your collection at the end of the round when its details are revealed. Your collection is always arranged in chronological order like a timeline of when hits were released, so as your collection grows, the time periods between the hits in your collection get narrower, meaning each subsequent guess you make will need to be more specific than the last.</li>
        <li>During your turn, you can win a token by calling out two additional facts about the hit that's playing. Typical examples are the song title, artist, a series, film or anything else that the song is known for. Any combination of facts can win a token, so long as there are two facts you've called out and they're both true. The player that comes after you confirms the accuracy of any additional facts you've offered, awarding your token if both were correct, or denying your token if either fact can't be verified. In future rounds, tokens can be spent on intercepting other players, or skipping hits that you don't recognize.</li>
        <li>After you've entered your guess at when the hidden hit was released, the other players will either agree with you, or if any other player has a different opinion, they can pay one token to intercept. Be quick with your interceptions, the first player to correctly identify when the hidden hit was released wins that card.</li>
        <li>Each round ends with the hidden hit being revealed. The player who guessed correctly gets to add the hit to their timeline, with the turn player taking precedence. For example, imagine it's your turn and you guess that the hidden hit was released before 1988. Another player intercepts and guesses it was released after 1988. When the hit is revealed, it turns out it was actually released in exactly 1988. It was your turn, so you would win that card.</li>
        <li>The first player to collect 10 hit cards wins the game.</li>
    </ol>
